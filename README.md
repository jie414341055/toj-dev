New TOJ is a Virtual Online Judge that supports different OJs and Contests. Besides, it has more features such as problem tagging, problem recommendation etc.

Right now it supports POJ, HDOJ, ZOJ, Ural, UVALive, SGU, TOJ.

The front-end was wrote in Node.js and the judger was wrote in C++. Right now it has one judger for each OJ, but I plan to make a universal judger with each OJ a configuration file.
